### Hi, I'm Gerb!
I'm a MSc. student Systems and Control at Delft University of Technology. I enjoy math, programming, robotics, control and endlessly tweaking my workflow to the point of insanity.

Lately I have been learning C++ as well as Rust due to an interest in Embedded (control) systems and robots!
